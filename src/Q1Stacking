Question: Given an empty stack, what will be in the stack after
the following operations?

a) push(3)
    Stack: 3
b) push(4)
    Stack: 4, 3
c) pop() - returns and removes item top of stack
    Returns: 4; Stack: 3
d) push(pop()*5) - perform pop() first, multiply by 5 then move to top of stack
    pop(stack) Return: 3; Stack: empty
    push(3*5)
    Stack: 15
e) push(10)
    Stack: 10, 15
f) push(pop()/4) - perform pop() first, divide by 4, then move to top of stack
    pop(stack) Return: 10; Stack: 15
    push(10/4)
    Stack: 2.5, 15

 Stack is implemented using linked list:
 - list's head node being the stack's top
 - push is performed by creating a new list node
