Question: For each algorithm, explain their time complexity and space
complexity using Big-O notation. Explain how you arrived at your answer.

Q4:
    Let n be the length of string parameter for stack.
    Time Complexity: O(n), two separate loops that are not nested into each other.
    Space Complexity: O(n), depending on the elements inside the string of the stack

Q5:
    Let n be the length of string parameter String a
    Time Complexity: O(n), use one for loop to run through the String and add to the Queue
    Space Complexity: O(1), constant time

Q6:
    Let n be the length of string parameter for RNA strand
    Time Complexity: O(n), use one for loop to iterate through the RNA strand
    Space Complexity: O(1), constant time
